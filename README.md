# Kalkulatorprosjekt
This is a school-project designed to get familiar with QT and get better at c++ programming.

I wanted to make a calculator, but not just a typical calculator that i could easily find sollutions to, therefore i made one that isn't all that good, but requires some thinking to get working.

The calculation part is nothing special, other than that it does not consider the correct order of calculation. IE it does the claculations in the order they are placed in the UT, not the order of operations on the numbers.

Also, the numbers are place in QLineEdits, while the operators are chosen in QComboBoxes.

This was to force me to find a way to add 2 different elements each time the "add new" button was clicked, and for these to copy the values of their originals.

I got it working, it really is not something that should be used, but it was a fun project.

Also - the UI doesn't scale propperly..This is a task for the future.
